		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
  I'm an Irish web developer, mediocre musician, and graduate of a rather odd degree called Music, Media and Performance Technology in University of Limerick. 
  I never really worked out what that degree is meant to prepare me for, but I do know that I got to spend a lot of time doing cool things, and somehow
  had a job at the end of it. So I guess that's a success! 
  </p>
  <p>
   You can generally find me messing around with some half-finished project on my laptop, 
  playing guitar/piano with friends, giving a hastily prepared speech at Toastmasters, or just 
chatting about nerdy stuff in <a href="http://091labs.com">091 Labs</a> (Galway's best and only hackerspace!). 
  
	</p>
	
	<p>
		In April 2013 I signed a pledge to donate at least 10% of my income to the <a href="http://givingwhatwecan.org/">most effective charities</a>, and
		am a firm believer that if you're going to spend resources trying to make the world a better place, you may as well
		try and get the most bang for your buck! I don't talk about that the do-gooder stuff much in person, because I usually
		feel like a bit of an ass when I do. If you're interested though, I'm more than happy to chat!
	</p>
	<p>
		This site is created in Angularjs, with a little JSON API hacked on to the front of the Anchor CMS blogging platform
		(which I was using to power the blog before I redid the frontend in Angular). I hope to 
		replace that soon with a new backend in Ruby or Python.
